Durani Mahirkhan Provide You a Code of c++ for Bachelor Of Application(BCA) And Other Technical And IT Related Student //

1.	C++ program to create a simple class and object and print “HELLO”.

2.	Create a class programming with two methods. Input_value for getting value of data and output_value for printing data using class and objects.

3.	Create a class “students”. Create two methods for input and output of students roll number, name, marks1, marks2, marks3, sum of marks and average of marks.

4.	Swapping of two number without using third variable. 

5.	Swapping of two number using “call by values”.

6.	Swapping of two number using “call by Reference”.

7.	Find the maximum number using “Return by reference”.

8.	Replace the first character of the string using “Return by reference”.

9.	Find the cube of number using “INLINE” function.

10.	Perform the arithmetic operations using “INLINE” functions.

11.	Even or odd. Program to enter an integer and find out if it is even or odd

12.	Sum and average. Program to enter two integers and find their sum and average.

13.	Prime or composite. Program to enter an integer and print if it is prime or composite.

14.	Sum, difference, product and quotient of two integers. C++ Program to find the sum, difference, product and quotient of two integers.

15.	String length Program to enter a string and find its length. 

16.	Biggest integer using IF. Program to enter three integers and output the biggest integer using IF

17.	Compute Net salary of each employee Given that an EMPLOYEE class contains following members: data members: Employee number, Employee name, Basic, DA, IT, Net Salary and 
print data members. Write a C++ program to read the data of N employee and compute Net salary of each employee (DA=52% of Basic and Income Tax (IT) =30% of the gross salary)

18.	Print USN, print the USN, Name and the average marks Define a STUDENT class with USN, Name and MARKS in 3tests of subject. Declare an array of 10 STUDENT objects. Using appropriate functions. Print USN, print the USN, Name and the average marks of all the students.

19.	Addition of two numbers using “public” data and public member function.

20.	Addition of two numbers using“private” member function.

21.	Print the values of number using “protected” data member.

22.	Calculate the area of circle using default value in argument.

23.	Sum, difference, product and quotient of two integers. C++ Program to find the sum, difference, product and quotient of two integers using INLINE function. 

24.	Calculate area of circle, rectangle, triangle and square using Function Overloading.
